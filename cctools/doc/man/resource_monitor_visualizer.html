<h2>NAME</h2>
<b>resource_monitor_visualizer.py</b> - create  pages and graphs of resource monitor data

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<tt><b>resource_monitor_visualizer.py data_path destination_path workflow_name</b></tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<b>resource_monitor_visualizer</b> is a tool to visualize resource usage of the
given workflow. The visualizer creates a series of web pages and graphs to
explore resource usage. Histograms are created for each group and resource.
Currently, groups are determined by command name. Additionally, if time series
data is recorded graphs are created to show the aggregate resource usage over
time.

<h2>ARGUMENTS</h2>
<table>
<tr><td> <b><tt> data_path</tt></b> <td>The path to the data recorded by the resource_monitor.
<tr><td> <b><tt> destination_path</tt></b> <td>The path in which to store the visualization.
<tr><td> <b><tt> workflow_name</tt></b> <td>The name of the workflow being visualized.
</table>

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

To visualize a collection of resource data:
<pre>
% resource_monitor.py /path/to/logs /home/guest/sites my_workflow
</pre>

<h2>BUGS</h2>

<dir>
<li> x-axis labels can overlap when using older versions of gnuplot.
<li> Aggregate time series plots are noisy.
<li> The layout is optimized for large displays and can become cluttered on smaller monitors.
